                    User privacy is of utmost importance to <b>TCPL (Tata Consumer Products Limited)</b> . TCPL has developed this <b>“Privacy Policy”</b>  which covers how TCPL collects, uses, discloses, transfers, and stores User information. <b>Tata Sampann </b> comes under the same purview of Privacy policy as developed by TCPL. And thus we also follow the same Privacy policy. Users are advised to familiarize themselves with TCPL privacy practices.

                        <ol>
                            <li>“Personal information” is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.</li>
                            <li>When Users register on TCPL, they shall provide TCPL their contact information, including their name, date of birth, telephone number, gender and email address. TCPL uses this information to send Users updates about their order, questionnaires to measure User satisfaction with TCPL’s service and announcements about new services that TCPL may offer. Users are also required to provide their billing address as well as credit/debit card details. TCPL uses this information only for billing and delivery purposes. For Users’ convenience, TCPL saves billing information in case Users want to order from TCPL again.</li>
                            <li>TCPL may hire other companies to provide limited services on its behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering User questions about products or services and sending postal mail. TCPL will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service.</li>
                            <li>TCPL may also use Personal Information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve TCPL services. TCPL may use the Personal information for promotional services including through social media to which Users give consent to it.</li>
                            <li>Users may browse the Website without disclosing to TCPL who they are or revealing any Personal Information about themselves. However, Users may not be able to access certain parts of the Websites if they chose to do so.</li>
                            <li>TCPL will occasionally ask the Users to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may ask the Users for contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). TCPL uses this data to tailor User experience on the Website, providing the Users with content that TCPL thinks Users might be interested in and to display content according to User preferences.</li>

                        <b>Manner of dealing with Personal Information</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li>TCPL gathers some information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</li>
                            <li>TCPL uses this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the Website, to learn about user behavior on the Website, and to gather demographic information about TCPL user base as a whole. TCPL may use this information in its marketing and advertising services.</li>
                            <li>TCPL uses Personal Information to provide the services that the User requests. TCPL will provide the User with the ability to opt-­‐out of such uses.

                            <li>When Users register themselves on the Website, TCPL creates User’s profile, assigning a personal identification number, this personal identification number is then sent back to User’s hard drive in the form of a “cookie”, which is a very small bit of code. This code is unique to each User. It enables seamless travel across the Website, allowing User to use the Website without having to enter his password frequently or fill out registration forms with information User has already provided.</li>
                            <li>TCPL uses cookies on certain pages of the Website to help analyseWebsite web page flow, deliver ads that relate to User’s interests, measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns and promote trust and safety. TCPL offers certain features that are only available through the use of a “cookie”. Cookies can also help TCPL provide information that is targeted to the User’s interests. Most cookies are “session cookies”, meaning that they are automatically deleted from the User’s hard drive at the end of a session. Users are always free to decline TCPL cookies by disabling cookies in their internet browser, although in that case the User may not be able to use certain features on the Website and the User may be required to re-­enter his password more frequently during a session.</li>
                            <li>Additionally, the User may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Website that are placed by third parties.
